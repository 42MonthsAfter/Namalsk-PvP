# Welcome to the Repo for 42 Months After's Namalsk-PvP Server!
In an effort to help support the DayZ community, we publish all our files for other server owners to use and reference. The only thing we ask is that you credit our work if you add any of it to your server. We will be making updates regularly so follow for changes and improvements.

## How to Use this Repo
You can check out the mpmissions and profile files for the tweaks and changes that we have made customizing our flavor of DayZ. We have removed anything that might be used against us like credentials and API tokens, but everything else is available for your use.
